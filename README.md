# Techplement
This project deploys WordPress and MySQL in monolithic and microservices architectures. In monolithic, both run on one public EC2 instance. In microservices, WordPress is on a public EC2 and MySQL on a private EC2. Built with Terraform, it uses modular code, secure networking, and demonstrates scalability and architecture transitions.
